# Portfolio

This repository contains the source code of my portfolio website, a live demo of which can be seen at https://vimprojects.com. The website is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (very basic Sass that is).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The waves seen are generated with [Haikei](https://app.haikei.app/).
